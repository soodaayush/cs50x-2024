## Inspiration

I decided to redo this course due to the new content and my desire to earn the verified certificate offered by edX.

## Challenges

I struggled mainly in the earlier weeks (Weeks 1 - 5) as I was required to write code in C, a language different from those I have used before.

## Lessons Learned

I learned about implementing algorithms, writing SQL, the fundamentals of Flask, and cybersecurity principles.

## The Repository

This repository contains all the problem sets I submitted to Harvardâ€™s `submit50` system to be graded, aiming to earn the certificate.

## Final Project

The final project is not in this repository, as it is in a separate repository. The final project I submitted was the Bay View High School mobile app: [link](https://github.com/soodaayush/BVHApp). Its function serves as a central place for information surrounding the school.
