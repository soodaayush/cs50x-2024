If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Since the average energy was high while the average valence was average, this would indicate that the user listens to both happy and sad music.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

We have such little data, since we only have the user's top 100 songs, meaning that the data can't be very accurate. If we had more data, meaning that we had more songs, we would be able to accurately determine what the user listens to.
